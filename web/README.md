# Frontend of Attendance

This frontend project is powered by React and Vite.

We use windicss for rapid UI development. `tailwindcss` is also listed in `package.json` as one of `devDependencies`, only for compatibility with tailwind VSCode plugin.

We use ESLint and Prettier to enforce coding styles.
